# Bootstrap-Button-Color-Schemer

I usually find myself tweaking the colors of bootstrap buttons to match the scheme of the rest of my site. So to save time here is a block of CSS for your `application.scss` file. You can set the base color of each button style and have the border colors and hover colors generated automatically thanks to Sass.
